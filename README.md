# mersenne
An implementation of the Lucas-Lehmer test for checking Mersenne primes.

The program uses Lucas-Lehmer test to check if a given exponent, n, leads to a Mersenne prime of the form 2^n-1. The program uses the GNU GMP library to handle large numbers. There are two files containing the main function: one is single_thread which uses a single thread. The other uses pthreads library to run multiple threads at the same time.

The library is meant for education purposes. The GIMP project includes a collaboration project with thousands of volunteers and much optimized code.
